Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation. We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry. We are looking for diverse talent across many different domains including designers, front end and back end development, product management, analytics and data science, credit, operations, and capital markets.We want passionate, fun-loving people who can contribute positively to our company and our culture. Let us know if this sounds like you.
<a href="http://www.insikt.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.insikt.com</a></p><p>Technologies: front-end: angular, react back-end: java(finagle), node, groovy, postgres

* transmission of data in a reliable fashion (both from the phone and the module which plugs into your car) to the decision system
* making decisions quickly and accurately based on incomplete data (due to dead zones, time shifts, etc)
* displaying decisions (building a UI both for the end user and for administration)
* integrating with telcos (since it is a carrier level solution)</p><p>Now, this problem isn't the same level of difficulty as say, "scaling AWS" or "inventing Google Maps", but I've found it to be an interesting problem.  It certainly is more than a phone only solution, which you imply.</p><p>That said, maybe I'm missing something obvious that would make the solution simple--I'd be happy talk to the hiring manager about paying you for an hour of your time to chat about your proposed solution if you'd be interested.

I'm primarily a backend developer, but have recently picked up enough C#/.NET to be dangerous, I'm just having trouble fully wrapping my head around the UI Automation framework. I think it'll be more effective to have someone with experience do this and let me focus on other pieces.<p>This won't be for malware/scammy stuff, it's user-voluntary to collect some context for a time tracking app similar to RescueTime.</p><p>I'm near Charlotte, NC, so someone I can meet in person would be preferred, but remote is perfectly fine. If you're actually reading this, include the word "DrPepper" in your email otherwise I'll just delete it - I got too much spam last time and very few actual code samples. This particular project is small but there is plenty more available for the right person.</p><p>Email a link to your github profile or a short C# .NET code sample to jobs at stridatum.com. No recruiters please.<span>

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.</p><p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 49,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:</p><p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and</p><p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.</p><p>We’re a team of 90 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.</p><p>Right now we're also particularly looking for a lead partner engineer: someone who's excited to help developers on our platform build products that schools and teachers truly love.</p><p>Check us out at <a href="https://clever.com/about/jobs" rel="nofollow">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a>, or check out our recent press here:

We raised $2.75m to date and have offices in Paris and San Francisco.</p><p>Our offices are in inner-city Paris, we speak English. We have an awesome international team, and have assisted with visas before.</p><p>In our Paris offices we are currently looking for:

Walmart's mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success. We started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.</p><p>We're still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.</p><p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It's a tough balance but we've found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.</p><p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:
  - high performance distributed systems
  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases
  - simple &amp; fast deployments
  - automating the hell out of operations
  - thorough system test coverage
  - managing our own development process and work backlog
  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)
  - contributing back to the clojure &amp; open source community
What we do:
  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure
  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems
  - spin up web services for consuming &amp; ingesting large volumes of data</p><p>For a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk we gave at Clojure/West last year. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4</a>.</p><p>Does this sound like something you're into?

Also, he likes Signal a lot.</p><p>If you really believe that we're entering a pitched battle between states and technology providers over encryption; that NSA and GCHQ are turning the world's best-funded best-staffed signals intelligence agencies into instruments of domestic surveillance; that giant corporations (and aspiring giant corporations) are doing everything they can to ensure that users <i>think</i> they're safe while their messages are scanned for ad targeting or censored and traced by despotic regimes; if these are real concerns for you, then this is one of the most important jobs on the Internet.</p><p>Until very recently, the iOS version of Signal was managed by Frederic Jacobs. Signal for iOS is a flagship Whisper offering. It should by rights be the most widely used tool for journalists, activists, and researchers to communicate confidently on an insecure Internet. Jacobs is amazing, but he's off to other adventures in Switzerland, and Whisper needs someone to take the reins on iOS Signal.</p><p>This is not the most highly-paid role on the Hiring Thread, but it's probably the one that stands to make the biggest dent in the universe. Why else would you consider joining Moxie and his crazy pirate crew of crypto developers?</p><p>* Because you're not a cryptographer but want to be engaged with serious cryptography, of the kind that will be in the academic cite record a decade from now, in a role where you'll make an enormous difference deciding how best to get strong crypto into the hands of everyday people.</p><p>* Because Moxie and his team are simply excellent people to work with, doing inspiring stuff that is <i>actually inspiring</i>, not cat-sharing.</p><p>* Because there are worse things to have on your resume than "product lead for the most important product by a tiny team that took on multi-billion dollar world government spy agencies and won".</p><p>* Because you relish the opportunity to be on an HN NSA thread with 'tptacek and be able, at any point, to say "shut up, Thomas, I work for Whisper".</p><p>I don't work for Whisper, Whisper will never pay me a dime. I just love what they do, know that they're trying very hard to find this particular person, and want to do whatever I can to help (and to ensure I'll be able to keep using Signal).</p><p>Full time role. Very strong iOS application skills needed. No cryptography experience needed at all (if you take this job, you're going to have crypto coming out of your ears either way). <i>The right candidate does not need to be in San Francisco</i>.</p><p><a href="https://whispersystems.org/workworkwork/" rel="nofollow">https://whispersystems.org/workworkwork/</a></p><p>If you know iOS developers who are interested in the problem Whisper is working on, please let them know about this.</p><p>Thanks!<span>

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.</p><p>On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.</p><p>Our bioengineers apply math to hard biological problems, ranging from liquid handling optimization to reasoning about how "identical" reagents diverge over time to interfere with reproducibility. You'll have an opportunity to do original research with internal capacity, too.</p><p>We're a rapidly growing startup, now 30-something people, well funded ($15M) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.</p><p>We're looking for talented engineers and bioengineers to join our team.

Contact jobs @ packetzoom.com or connect with me (Founder/CEO) personally using one of the methods in my profile. UNSOLICITED RECRUITER MAIL WILL BE FLAGGED AS SPAM IMMEDIATELY.<p>Mobile Networks are different. And yet we continue using the same legacy protocol stack (TCP/HTTP/SSL) to connect mobile devices to the cloud. We are changing this with radically new tech. If you want to help, come join us.</p><p>Packetzoom is rethinking the whole stack from the ground up. You get to hack network and/or security protocols, innards of mobile operating systems and build a global distributed system around brand new protocols. It's a small (but well funded) team so everyone contributes in everything.</p><p>PACKETZOOM ENGINEERING LEADER</p><p>If you have shipped products or built services where you (at least) actually had to deal with unix at the syscall level (either in the userspace or kernel) in C/C++ code, we want to talk to you.</p><p>If you were responsible for shipping and maintaining the product for a decent amount of time, we really want to talk to you.</p><p>You'd be joining a small, elite team of engineers who build and run the PacketZoom stack (<a href="https://packetzoom.com/learn.html" rel="nofollow">https://packetzoom.com/learn.html</a>) on millions of mobile client devices (iOS, Android and any others we decide to pursue) as well as our globally distributed cluster of servers running our own C++ and java code. We also harvest and process millions of mobile network performance data points in realtime while squeezing every last ounce of performance out of the hardware. If that sounds like fun to you, please do connect.</p><p>SENIOR ENGINEERS</p><p>We're also looking for smart Software Engineers to join our team in individual roles. We're looking for smart generalists who can dig into any given area depending on the need of the day. The areas of focus range iOS and Android platform specific work (C++, Java/ObjC), to Data Engineering and analysis at massive scale for the global mobile network performance metrics, visualization and alerting on detecting trends in said data etc. Basically a whole lot of fun for the motivated computer scientist.</p><p>We're venture funded and have paying customers.

Junior, senior, doesn't matter. What matters is that you're smart, knowledgeable about CS, and incredibly passionate about games. Message me via jmazer@riotgames.com if you want to chat.</p><p>I search for people who are passionate about games. Not the kinds that just dabble, and who sometimes reminisce about that time that they played Mario back in the day. I look for the kinds that can literally count their play time in years rather than days. Notice - I'm not talking about League... That's because R&amp;D is focused on making Riot's NEXT game. We're looking at several different spaces and we need talent with as varied a palette of interests as our development interests.</p><p>I'm not only looking for industry veterans. If you come from a Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc., and want to keep your standard of living, work on games, and also keep a high level of stability, Riot is a great place to consider making an industry change.</p><p>Reasons you might want to chat:</p><p>1.) Riot believes in delivering genre-defining content that delights players. The R&amp;D group's charter is to flesh out and eventually ship the game(s) that put the 's' in Riot Games. If you want to build new stuff this is the place to be.</p><p>2.) We’ve only got a few R&amp;D projects going at a time, with a handful of people on each team. Joining the team now means playing a seminal role in developing and leading the downstream organization.</p><p>3.) Riot landed as #13 on Fortune's top 100 companies to work for.</p><p>4.) We’re exploring some familiar genres and some experimental ones, but all of them are genres we expect core gamers love. It's likely you'll be excited by at least one of our current projects.<span>

The ideal candidate is someone who plans to become a lead engineer (or perhaps a product manager) in the not too distant future.</p><p>We're a small team tackling the absolutely massive mortgage market. We're bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manilla envelopes. We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.</p><p>The type of problems we're tackling involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.</p><p>Snapdocs’ culture is one that trusts its team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as seeking collaboration. We're becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we're looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.</p><p>==Job Description and Required Skills==</p><p>* Rails Engineer. 3+ years experience, but more is welcome. Ideally, you're a full stack coder. But in reality, you probably lean either towards the front or the back end. That's fine, so long as you know (and enjoy) your strengths.</p><p>* Being the 5th member of on a fast-growing technical team. This means helping to form a healthy and happy culture. We strive to be respectful of each other's time and point of view. We're learning how to do this together. We want to create a place where it's OK to fail, and that you know the team has your back the whole way through.</p><p>* Self-motivated. To us that means when you get an interesting problem, you will rip into it until you understand its nuances and perhaps have a glimpse of the solution.</p><p>* Empathy. We work closely with our customers, meaning phone calls, emails, and sometimes lunch. It is important in this job to listen to them so that we can build what they need and want.</p><p>* Knowledge of AWS would be excellent.</p><p>* UX experience (or interest in cultivating it) would be excellent.</p><p>Send an email to jobs@snapdocs.com telling us about yourself. Please include a resume and a link to github (and specific github repos) if your profile is informative.<span>

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn't matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you're smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.</p><p>Pivotal's goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We're broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.</p><p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Berlin and Sydney. More offices are coming soon. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.</p><p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. Right now we are particularly trying to grow in Labs and Cloud Foundry.</p><p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.</p><p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We're the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We're constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.</p><p>It's also the only PaaS I'd personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD'd. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.</p><p>-- <i>Generally</i></p><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it's popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that's life in paradise.</p><p>You can apply through our website: <a href="http://pivotal.io/careers" rel="nofollow">http://pivotal.io/careers</a>.

I have only positive things to say about working here. The people are intelligent and helpful, a lot of interesting problems to solve and the work hours are unbelievably sane. The company is strongly data driven and very dynamic, which was one of its biggest charms for me. Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :) The Dutch government also gives a huge tax break through the 30% ruling to non-dutch people.</p><p>The work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very finely tuned.They take care of you from the moment you get an offer to the point you have set up your house in Amsterdam. Several people have reached out to me from these threads and have been flown to Amsterdam for interviews. Around 10 people have been given offers and more are in the middle of the interview process.</p><p>If you have any other questions about the company or the hiring process or you would like me to refer you, please feel free to send me an email at siddharthsarda01 at gmail.com (Email also in my profile at Hacker news).</p><p>To have an idea of the kind of problems being solved here, you can also look at our dev blog: <a href="http://blog.booking.com/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.booking.com/</a></p><p>We are hiring for our headquarters office in Amsterdam:

SpotHero is changing parking, and our tools will redefine the transportation industry. With over a million cars parked, fast growth, and solid funding (<a href="https://angel.co/spothero" rel="nofollow">https://angel.co/spothero</a>), SpotHero offers countless ways to make an impact on the company and your career.<p>Director of Development - <a href="http://spothero.com/careers/126707" rel="nofollow">http://spothero.com/careers/126707</a>
As the Director of Development, you'll thoughtfully lead our team of engineers in supporting and growing our business. You must enjoy the hands-on work of a day-to-day developer (coding, design, and problem solving), in addition to leading engineers, communicating closely with our executives, and determining the best use of new technologies - all the while nurturing and maintaining a development culture that SpotHero can be proud of.</p><p>Senior Software Engineer in Test - <a href="http://spothero.com/careers/91854" rel="nofollow">http://spothero.com/careers/91854</a>
QA is a part of every engineer's process here at SpotHero. However, we need someone dedicated to bringing automated test best practices to the team, and someone that can figure out how to test the really hard things. We have a love/hate relationship with Selenium. And if you don't know why, then you're probably not ready for this role. Come help us tame the beast...</p><p>Lead Software Engineer, iOS/Android - <a href="http://spothero.com/careers/108372" rel="nofollow">http://spothero.com/careers/108372</a>
No, we don't expect you to build both iOS and Android apps by yourself. BUT, you should know how to!! This role is half managing the iOS &amp; Android apps, and half architecting &amp; developing. You'll have both iOS and Android developers (1 for each platform) on your team, and you should be able to jump back and forth, as needed. If you're a first time manager, no worries; we'll coach you on those skills. Just be sure you're a master of both platforms.</p><p>Senior Backend Engineer - <a href="http://spothero.com/careers/124847" rel="nofollow">http://spothero.com/careers/124847</a>
As a member of our Backend team, you will be responsible for building all things related to the backend horsepower that powers our website, our API, and our native apps!</p><p>Software Engineer, Android - <a href="http://spothero.com/careers/88317" rel="nofollow">http://spothero.com/careers/88317</a>
SpotHero is a mobile product. If you love building Android apps, you'll love what we've got in store. We have an amazing Android app, that we're looking to do a full ground up redesign on. So there is a lot of bluesky work in the very near future.</p><p>Summer Software Engineering Intern - <a href="http://spothero.com/careers/118124" rel="nofollow">http://spothero.com/careers/118124</a>
College interns are as important as Lead Engineers at SpotHero. They are the future of our team, and the future of our industry. You'll be paired with a Senior Engineer from day 1, and solving real problems that make it to production your first week. Buckle up and hold on tight, you're about to learn a crap ton here!!</p><p>To apply, please email your resume to jobs@spothero.com. Include any github account, linkedin profile, and any project that you’re particularly proud of. We love seeing work that others loved working on.<span>

</p></div></span><span class="c00">San Francisco, CA- Programmers, Infrastructure, Sales<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do "expense reports that don't suck!" (Google "expensify" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines.</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.
And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!<span>

We take real world government data and research, and turn them into interactive data viz tools. The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a country’s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. Last year we launched a Mexican Atlas <a href="http://complejidad.datos.gob.mx/" rel="nofollow">http://complejidad.datos.gob.mx/</a> which allows users to explore data and understand policy effects at regional and local levels. This year we are launching similar tools in Colombia and Peru.</p><p>Our stack:
We use python, django, mysql (hopefully postgres soon), elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. For the frontend, it's ember / d3 on the country projects, jquery/d3 on atlas.cid.harvard.edu/ and WebGL with Three.js on some 3d projects that we’ve launched such as globe.cid.harvard.edu/ Everything we do is open source: <a href="https://github.com/cid-harvard" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cid-harvard</a></p><p>Demo of the current atlas:
An example of how the atlas is useful take this story here: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/21/world/europe/how-much-europe-depends-on-russian-energy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/21/world/europe/h...</a></p><p>Recently the EU placed sanctions on sales of oil equipment, but not on oil imports. Why could this be? Almost 70% of russia's exports are petrol products: <a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all/show/2014/" rel="nofollow">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all...</a></p><p>And Russia exports the overwhelming majority of its petroleum products to Europe:
<a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/show/2709/2014/" rel="nofollow">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/sho...</a></p><p>The big blue chunk is europe, meaning a sanction would really hurt Russia. However, when you look at who else the EU could buy from, the situation is grim: <a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/show/all/2709/2014/" rel="nofollow">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/sho...</a></p><p>There’s practically no one who’s a real political ally that Europe could depend on, save for Norway. It’s interesting how it’s practically impossible to buy oil from a country that’s relatively stable and doing well on the HDI front.
It’s worse if you consider the cost of transporting it, and how close Russia is:
<a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all/2709/2014/" rel="nofollow">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all...</a></p><p>Which probably explains why EU hasn't placed sanctions on oil imports from Russia.</p><p>Think you could design/build/use this better? We think you can too!</p><p>Get in touch:Send us some work you're proud of to greg_shapiro at hks dot harvard dot edu.<span>
